00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,980
Hi and welcome To Lesson [one] of this Deep Learning MOOC. Thanks for Joining Us I'm Jeremy Howard and I'm Rachel Thomas

2
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:14,670
We're The People who put This together you'll be Seeing my face in Front of the Camera Most of the Time?

3
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:17,219
You'll Be Hearing Rachel's Voice However

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,009
[I'll] be asking Questions that are Coming Through a, slack Channel asked by students in the In-Person Version of this Course

5
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,549
So we thought before We Started We Should Tell you a little bit About?

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,250
What to Expect and Maybe you get to know Us a [little] bit

7
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:31,769
My Background is Really in

8
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:39,000
Coding and Data I spent 10 Years of Management Consulting and 10 Years Running Startups

9
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:43,859
Throughout That [Time] I've Been using Data and Machine [Learning] to try to solve Problems

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:50,160
My Backgrounds A lot more Academic and Theoretical I have a Phd in Math and Then I worked as a quant

11
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,699
Later as A software [Engineer] and Data scientist [-] at Uber

12
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,320
[One] of the Most fun exciting Parts of my [life]

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,099
Was when [I] spent some Time Really Competing Heavily in Capital Competitions [I]?

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,659
Was Really Pleased to win some of Those Competitions and Get to the Top of the leaderboard and

15
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,699
I'm hoping to show you guys during this Course some of the techniques that I used to do that

16
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,159
I think the techniques that allowed When [Cackled] Competitions are The Same as the techniques that allow you to create

17
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,639
Great Results on your own Models in Solving your own Problems?

18
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:28,529
We also both love Teaching and so type Calculus 1 [&] 2

19
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,400
When I was in Graduate [School] and?

20
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,329
Then I later Left my job as a software Engineer to teach

21
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:39,269
Full-Stack Software Development Women at hack rate Academy for a year and a half I think that's Really cool Rachel

22
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,920
was a quant and then she Worked with Both the Data scientist and a source tech Engineer uber

23
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:50,909
But She realized that one of the highest Leverage Things you can do is to teach and it's great Fun - I

24
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:55,258
Feel the Same Way even When I was Running Startups I was Creating?

25
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:04,380
Course Content online for Example on the Left here is an AngularJS tutorial that I originally created from my colleagues at Kaggle

26
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,220
But I recorded it and put it online and it's Had over 200,000 views

27
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:12,179
Makes you Feel Really good to [know] that People are Learning

28
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,029
From Some of the Things That I found Really Helpful Myself

29
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,749
so this is a Quote from paul lockhart who, was A and

30
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,740
He was Actually working as a primary School math teacher got

31
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:32,079
His Phd in Math at Columbia and Became A math Professor at Brown and then Left to go back to teaching Primary School

32
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,220
And he's written A

33
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:41,050
Wonderful Asset Called A mathematicians will meant on everything that's Horrible About how Mathematics Is Taught in The United States Yeah I think that that

34
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,960
Essay has Been Really Influential to Both Rachel and I

35
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,139
Although Rachel Stuck With her Math Education for

36
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:54,279
Decades Longer Than I did We Both Definitely Felt like modern Mathematics education is not done well

37
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,529
Paul Lockhart Uses a Wonderful Analogy about Imagine if With Music

38
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:04,900
We didn't Allow Children To sing or play Instruments until they had spent

39
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:12,820
Years and Even Decades Studying Set Theory and Music Notation and Could transcribe Scales and Only then Once They

40
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:18,609
Were in Their 20s, We would let them create Music he Says that's Exactly what, we're Doing Is Mathematics but They?

41
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,300
Don't We Should Let People kind of

42
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:26,439
Play and Create and Build Patterns With It and Something [very] Similar happens with Deep Learning and how its Taught

43
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:32,049
In fact One of my heroes is a guy Called David Perkins who at

44
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,300
Harvard Has Created some Really

45
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:41,409
Interesting Research About effective Educational Techniques and he Is very Similar Analogy to lockhart that he [Talks] About

46
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,339
Baseball Imagine if the way you like Baseball

47
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,340
Was that You Never saw A game of Baseball?

48
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,929
But Instead you learned About how to SKetch your baseball and you [learnt] the physics [a] Parabola and you learn Every Aspect

49
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,410
of Baseball and Then After 20 Years of Study Should be Considered Good Enough to go and Actually Watch your first Game

50
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:06,549
[We] tend to think that This Is Ralph as A way that most mathematics Perhaps Particularly Including Deep Learning is Really Taught

51
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,980
so, we

52
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,480
Decided When, we set up a, research lab that Say I that the first Thing

53
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:20,259
We would do Would be to try and Fill this need and Particularly We Decided to Focus on Deep Learning because?

54
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,260
We both Think That Deep Learning is the?

55
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,109
Most exciting Technology that, We have ever Seen?

56
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:32,860
We think it's going to be more transformative Than Even Than the Internet and so the more People who Can Participate the Better

57
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:39,010
Entering has Called it the new Electricity so kind of to Say that it's going to have the Impact on society That Electricity has

58
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,870
so

59
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:48,190
Some of The Kinds of Problems we've Seen With Technical change like These and I just want to say we're Introducing that to tell you?

60
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,589
That This Course Is Taught in A very Different Style and so

61
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:55,750
We want to Kind of set your Expectations Ahead of Time and motivate why? It's so different how, We teach it Here?

62
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,030
And One is that a lot

63
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:05,619
[of] them Existing Deep Learning Materials are very Math Centric and even as a mathematician and someone who loves Math I found them to be

64
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,940
Pretty Unhelpful for

65
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:15,520
Actually Building and Creating Practical Applications in Fact Every Time I see Somebody Ask on A forum or on Hacker News Whatever

66
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:20,619
What do I [need] in Order to get Into Deep Learning a, whole Bunch of People Replied by Saying

67
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:26,860
Well First you need Five Years of Real Analysis and Vector Analysis and then you need to study Probability and Statistics

68
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:34,929
And bla bla bla bla bla and it Really Comes across to me [as] something Which is all About being exclusive Rather than

69
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,749
Inclusive so that's why, We have This Little?

70
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,220
Thing

71
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:45,190
Making Neural Nets and cool again it's kind of out Yeah I slogan yes [Ai] Slogan

72
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:52,570
We're all About not being exclusive but About making Things as Simple as [Possible] but Never About

73
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,410
Dumbing it Down

74
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,150
Right

75
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,150
Another Way that Kind of

76
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:06,160
Technical Education Fails Is what David Perkins and the Harvard Professor Jeremy Mentioned a moment Ago called Element itis

77
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,339
And that's that often Masked Us

78
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,250
[of] so much

79
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,870
It teaches Kind of each

80
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:17,739
separate Element and it's only at the end when you've learned all the Elements Needed that you Can put them Together and See the whole

81
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,730
Thing and That's Kind of what was going on in That Baseball Analogy and that happens in A lot

82
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:22,900
Of Deep Learning it's like you know

83
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,999
We need to teach you Probability Theory and We need to teach you Information Theory and Only Way Later

84
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,260
On we're Going to Let you put it together you can think of it as being depth first rather than

85
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:38,080
breadth-first. If you like so the traditional depth-first approach, means that you as a student have to trust that at

86
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,979
some point all these things are going to come together and turn into something that's genuinely useful. I

87
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:51,509
think with this breadth-first approach you Still have to trust this Different kind of trust which Is that it's okay [that]

88
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:59,489
When, We first Show you an End-To-end Process that you don't Deeply Understand Every Part but [that] you are able to actually

89
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,669
do Useful Things

90
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:06,179
From The very first Lesson and [that] as the Lessons go Along you're Going to get More and More in Depth Understanding

91
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:10,709
Of each Piece and Two ways that the Element Titus or the Depth-First?

92
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:15,568
Approach Fails Are One is Motivation A lot of Students Kind, of Give Up because they

93
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:18,148
Don't have the Motivation of Seeing how are These going to fit Together

94
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:24,359
And then Secondly it's Harder to get the like you, don't have the Contacts when, you're Learning all These discrete Elements and you

95
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,809
Can't Learn How They're Going to fit Into the Process until Later

96
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,939
Right and in Fact This goes together With the idea of using A code Centric

97
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:38,998
Approach Instead of A math Centric Approach with A code Centric Approach and Looking at the whole Game that Is an End-To-end

98
00:07:39,369 --> 00:07:44,159
Machine Learning Process From The very start it means that you can do Experiments you can

99
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:49,708
[Actually] Run Experiments and See what Goes in and out of each Part of the System and Build Up that Intuition

100
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:54,718
And if This whole Game Analogy I'm intrigued to David Perkins has a book Called Making Learning

101
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:58,289
Holes Where he goes Into A lot more Detail About it I love That Book

102
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,979
So then not not only are We going to be Showing you?

103
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:08,879
End-To-end Processes From This very First Lesson but These Processes are Going to not going to Just end up with good enough results

104
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:15,539
Nearly all of the Deep Learning educational Materials I've Seen so far get you to a point Where

105
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:20,159
You Can Kind of get an okay, ish result now the whole Point of Deep Learning

106
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:25,288
Is that you can get State-Of-The-Art results and so in the very first Piece of Code, we're going to run

107
00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:28,528
We're Going to run a piece of code Which gives you a State-Of-The-Art Result

108
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:35,580
We know something is A state of [the] [Art] result If It is Better than other Approaches That People have Tried

109
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:40,259
The Best way to know that is to try [Things] on a [Kaggle] Competition Having

110
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,620
Been The President and Chief scientist of [Kaggle] I saw again and again That Every [Kaggle]

111
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:50,760
Competition Beat All Previous Academic States State of the Art results so very often in This Course

112
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,719
We're Actually going to use [kaggle] benchmarks and See if We Can Beat Because

113
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,480
We know if We Can then that's truly A, well best?

114
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,589
So this is from Actually A very Good Book

115
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:08,189
It's the Young good Fellow [Yoshi] of ngo Deep Learning Book

116
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:15,179
But it's A very Good math Book which teaches you the math of Deep Learning and so in This Book when they Say?

117
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:22,049
Here is how We gain some Intuition in how to back Propagation Through Time Works this is how They Develop Intuition?

118
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:26,159
Rachel as a math Phd did you find this Helped your Intuition

119
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:32,310
will Have A very Different Approach to Intuition so this is a good book if you're Interested in Math and

120
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,130
TheoreMs in This Course, We're Really Going to be Focused on Code

121
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,110
[in] fact This is what [Rachel] and I put together When

122
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:47,190
We were Trying to explain Back Prop and Specifically Stochastic Gradient descent and the Use of Back Prop There, was We created a Spreadsheet?

123
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,190
And we Found each Time that We Taught our Students in The In-Person Course Through A?

124
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:59,579
Spreadsheet They Could See Every Single Piece of what was going on every single Intermediate result it [was] very

125
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:06,689
Easy for Them to Experiment With and so one of the unusual things, We do Is that you'll See That Nearly Every Major

126
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:13,379
Idea is presented at some Point using a spreadsheet, We present it in Many Different Ways but Spreadsheets?

127
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:17,789
Diagrams and Code Three of the key Ways that We present These ideas?

128
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:22,020
We believe This is The first Deep Learning Course in The World to implement A?

129
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:29,070
Convolutional Neural Network in an Excel Spreadsheet [and] [also] as you See from this Page not Just to [guess] The Gradient descent but A

130
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,229
Degrade RMSprop [Adam] and Even [Eve] Which just Came out A few Weeks ago

131
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,750
Or modern examples of

132
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:40,529
Accelerated Sgd Approaches

133
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:47,849
so I think everything you Really need to know about the Course Comes in This very first Piece of Code [that] you See

134
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:53,250
And This very First Piece of Code [that] you see you can see that there's a number of Things Going on?

135
00:10:53,820 --> 00:11:00,359
The First Is that this Piece of Code Shows not Just how to complete a project but

136
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,849
How to get a State-Of-The-Art Result on a project this Particular Piece [of] Code Gives you

137
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,100
97% Accuracy in Terminating Cats Versus Dogs

138
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:17,559
As Recently as about Five Years Ago [see] State of the Art for this Particular Problem, was About [80%] Accuracy

139
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:22,180
It's also an Example of Showing why

140
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:27,970
Working With Code Is so interesting rather than Showing Math

141
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,580
What we're Showing here Is Some working Code and I'll give you an example of what that means you Can?

142
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,800
Do so the Code Environment that

143
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:42,279
We're Working in Is something called Jupiter Notebook and you'll be using This in Every Single Lesson Throughout the Course and

144
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,909
Enjoy the Notebook as you can See, we Provide you with?

145
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:52,990
[Prose] and Information About What's Going on and Redraw Pictures and at any [Point] in Time

146
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,339
You Can Take a look at, one of These results and you can

147
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,900
You Can Take a look at

148
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,759
One of These results and you Can Look to see what's going on Behind the Scenes [so] for example in this case

149
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,480
We're Running something Called

150
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,759
[Ggg] Predict and we're Getting back some Probabilities and you might Wonder

151
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:19,450
Well what's [VGG] That Predicts Actually Doing so at any Time you Can Take Anything and put Two Question Marks on The front and

152
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,770
Run that Piece of Code and it will actually Show you the

153
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:31,869
Full Documentation and Source Code of what You just ran Now in this case it's Actually running a Function that We wrote for you?

154
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:36,760
One of the other Different Things About this Course Is that we're Not [Just] Showing you how

155
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:44,619
Existing Libraries Work But Every Time, We Found that using somebody Else's library Takes more than four or five lines of Code?

156
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,030
We would Make Sure We Found a way to do it Easier so Generally Speaking?

157
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:54,640
We show you how to do Things in One line of Code and then you Can Look Behind the Scenes and See what the lines

158
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,699
of Code Are Actually Doing so for example in this Case

159
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:03,610
The Predict Method is Running some other Predict Method Called Model Dot Predict and

160
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:11,590
So then what I always Encourage [People] to do is to do some Experiments so what does Model dot Predict Actually, do

161
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:18,249
One Thing that you can do in Chip your Notebook at any Time is to press Shift Tab a couple of Times

162
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,380
When you Press Shift Tab first Time it Pops Up it tells you what

163
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:28,719
Parameters you need to Pass This Method and it, also tells you what the Method Actually Does

164
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,270
If

165
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,839
You Press it Three Times it then Gives you

166
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,460
Additional Information About What each of Those arguments Are and What they're Expecting and what it returns

167
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,870
So it's really, Nice That

168
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:47,979
Using This Method you Can find out Exactly what's going on Behind the Scenes [and] do some Experiments and

169
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,560
So then [if] Example you could find out okay?

170
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,089
Well what is the Shape what Is the Size and Shape of the Array [that] This Thing returns?

171
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,310
[What] are The first Four Elements the Classes that are in This

172
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,229
Object and so Forth and This is really the way to

173
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,650
Use This Style of Teaching

174
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:13,089
Effectively it's to have the Code in Front of you all the Time and in

175
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:18,130
Every Line Look and See what's being Cuffed in What's Coming out what Else Could?

176
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:24,399
We do with [that] and then even Look at the Documentation so VGG Model is Apparently a

177
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,110
[Keras] Model Dot sequential so if We Would Just Copy that Into

178
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,650
[Google]

179
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:42,670
Then, We Can click on the first item and Find out Exactly what's going on what Is being Used here what are the other Methods

180
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:46,400
That This Could Take and then, We Can try Calling some of These other Methods

181
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,300
and See what kind of Results We get

182
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,210
so Really what We're Trying to do Is in the two hours of each Lesson

183
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,649
We're Trying to give you enough Information to get you Started With your own

184
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:03,549
Experiments, We're Not Trying to teach you everything and we're Certainly not Assuming that the Lesson Can stand alone

185
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:09,070
And we'll Talk more About this in A moment but The Videos are Just a small part of the Course but the Ipython

186
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,989
Notebooks and The [Coder] Huge Resource and We'll Talk About some of the other Resources that, We have Available for you?

187
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:18,219
But the important Thing to realize With These six lines of Code

188
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:23,800
Is that you Can run this for Anything not Just A dog versus Cat but These first six lines of Code you learn

189
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,560
Well Actually as it Says here Work for any Image Recognition

190
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,210
[Task] With Any Number of Categories so if you can get This far [in] Today's Lesson

191
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,740
Then You fly to, do

192
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:39,669
One of the most important Types of Computer Vision Which is image Classification or any Number of Categories for any Type of images

193
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,490
As Rachel Said we've Actually run this Course Already?

194
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:50,499
Specifically what you're Going to be Seeing are The recorded Lessons from an Interesting Course

195
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,740
And we thought it'd be Helpful for you to see what some of our?

196
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:59,289
Students Said About That [Impacts] and Cost Because it might Help you, should be A more effective Learner

197
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:05,950
And I do want to say I'm again because this Course Is Taught in Such a Different Way that

198
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:13,899
It Takes some face Kind of that this new Technique and is Worth Trying and Kind of sticking With but you can See that

199
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:20,739
Almost all the students Said that this, was that the Homework assignments Were very Helpful or?

200
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,370
Extremely Helpful in Understanding the Material

201
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:29,200
and the class resources Which includes the Wiki the scripts that

202
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,450
We give you [our] Forums our Slack Channel?

203
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:36,610
We're very Helpful or extremely Helpful and I want to [moshe] [Andrey] and We wanted to Mention that because

204
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,409
Rachel and I [are] Both being Kind of Coursera Addicts in the Past and Udacity [Addicts] and

205
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:47,889
Generally Speaking, We all often Watch a video at, [One-And-A-Half] [Speed] or two Speed and Just dip Through them

206
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:55,449
This Is not Designed to be Possible to do that this Way this is designed that you need to use the Homework

207
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,829
Assignments and The Class Resources so as you can [See] from the people who Have Already Been Through this Class

208
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,670
They Are Actually Finding These are Really Important Parts of the Overall Course

209
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:08,050
If each Video is giving you you're Kind of Seeing an end to end Process of

210
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:13,239
Solving A real Problem with Deep Learning and that means that There's not Though A separate Video on

211
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:19,449
Reddit This is Everything you need [to] know About AWs in your environment and This is everything you need to know about

212
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:25,210
This Piece of Code but Rather You're Kind of Seeing The end end Process but You'll See it again and again

213
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,820
Throughout The Lessons Now it's [okay] if you're Coming, Into this Course With either A very large

214
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:34,269
Amount Or A very Small Amount of Data science Background

215
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,609
Everybody in The [In-Person] Course Simply Had to have had at least a year [of] Coding [Experience]

216
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,209
[Even] With [A] very wide Variety in Background

217
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,440
[Nearly] Everybody Said They Found the Pace About right for Them and the Reason [for] that I think Is that we really?

218
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,100
Give People the Ability to pick up as much as little as they want

219
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,419
Through The Forums if You want to dig very very Deep Into

220
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:03,009
Advanced Topics you can Or if Absolutely everything is new to you

221
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:08,710
[Then] [That's] Fine Too there'll Be More than enough to do Just to get Through the basic Parts of your assignments and

222
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:15,310
Of Course on the Forums Would be very Happy to help you with all [of] your Questions There and if You are more Advanced

223
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:21,190
We really Appreciate your Help in Adding new Material to the Wiki answering others Questions on the Forums?

224
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:26,980
People Started Their Own Threads on the Forums Around Kind of Outside Related topics that they, were interested in

225
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,070
There are A Lot of Different Ways to be involved [so]

226
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:34,960
[Here's] A couple of Quotes We got from People after they completed the in Percent Clause and

227
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,400
This Is One That

228
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:43,540
We heard Again [and] Again so for example This Person Says I personally Fell Into the Habit of Watching the lectures too much and

229
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,070
Googling Definitions and Concepts and so Forth Too much Without Running the Code

230
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,860
At first I thought that I should Read the Code Quickly and then Spend Time Researching the Theory Behind it

231
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:01,239
in Retrospect I should have spent the Majority of my Time on the actual Code in the Notebooks Instead in Terms of Running It and

232
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:06,610
Seeing what goes Into It and Seeing what Comes out of it and [Actually] I know You've Seen similar things in your past

233
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:13,300
Teaching Error That I'Ve Seen This that in Teaching Called [Back] Software development and Students and I also know that I've Been Guilty of

234
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,630
It Myself

235
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,650
Sometimes

236
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:21,190
And that was that Students Would Sometimes Kind of Rather Than start Their Project they Would Keep Doing more and more Research

237
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:26,590
Reading More and More Tutorials and Feeling Like There's More and More They need to learn before They Can Start Coding

238
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,090
and two problems With that are

239
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:33,610
One and i mean [you] want to [have] some Background before you Begin but There's a point Where you [just] need to start Coding

240
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,300
Because you Can't know Exactly what you're Going to need until you start

241
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,710
Coding and Building and Seeing What Errors you get and what things you don't know how to do

242
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:47,710
and then Secondly the Test of Whether you understand something is whether you Can build with It [and]

243
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:54,000
So kind of Reading Tutorials it's very Possible to think, "Oh, I understand all this" -- but it's not Till you're writing Code Yourself

244
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,760
Kind of Seeing what your error rates Are and What

245
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,340
what's Working and what's not that you Know Whether or not to Really Understand Something

246
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,940
yeah so when I saw Students at the study Sessions during the week at

247
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:11,970
Usf I would Keep Going and the Same Thing again and again Just don't stop and Wait Till you Feel Ready to Code

248
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,690
Start Coding Now

249
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,310
And it's Through [that] Coding

250
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:20,039
[Experience] that you're Actually going to Figure out what you don't know and what you do know and Joey has developed the

251
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,200
Intuition By Running Lots of Experiments

252
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,470
[This] is Another Interesting Quote

253
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,930
From Somebody Talking About

254
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:33,839
This Learning Style He Said it's Been very Interesting Learning from Somebody who IS an Entrepreneur that

255
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:39,660
We make A very No-Nonsense Approach to getting Things Done very Hands-on very Smart and driven

256
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:46,019
Your usual Career Instructor is Quite the Opposite so it's Been Refreshing and Even Somewhat Shocking

257
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:52,199
This is Possibly understating things A bit it can be that We heard from quite A few People [at] the start it was

258
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:59,430
Somewhat Shocking To find so Many Things Taught so Quickly and it Kind of

259
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:06,749
Can Seem like Such a high level but of Course by the end of the seven Weeks and Assuming that each Time you're Putting 10

260
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,660
Hours Into Those Weeks you've Actually got

261
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:18,180
Many Many Full End-To-end Processes under your belt so by the end of it you're Actually going to Develop A very Deep and complete Understanding

262
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:23,219
Yeah I know after the first Lesson I heard a number of Students Kind of Say Things like

263
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:28,470
Oh I i didn't really get the Details from that Lesson and you know I feel like I need to Spend all [this] Time Understand

264
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,160
Studying The Details

265
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,910
and We hadn't Talked The Details in The first Lesson and

266
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,539
The idea Is that kind of We went More and More in Depth each Time

267
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,500
You're Seeing This End-To-end

268
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:44,940
Process and Then Kind of as Time Goes on digging Into it more but even After The first Lesson you Can apply it you can

269
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,270
Actually Create

270
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:50,520
World-Class Image Recognition [Models] and so you can go back to your Organization

271
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:57,420
and start Trying [Things] This is something Else We encourage People to do try things With your Own Data and your own Problems from the

272
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,420
very first Lesson

273
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,450
So it's been A

274
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,750
Interesting Experience in Every Way even the way

275
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,740
We built This Course is unusual?

276
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:12,450
for Example I actually wrote Most of the material real While Traveling from the Northern Tip to the southern Tip of

277
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,530
Japan I

278
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:19,259
Coded and wrote in Every possible place Six [imagined]

279
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:26,490
[and] this was a really an Experiment for me Because I studied Human Learning Theory A lot and I know that it is very

280
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:32,070
Human Creativity Is meant to be Better when you have a wider Variety of Contexts

281
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:40,350
Interestingly I Actually Found I was more Productive in That Month [Than] I feel I ever Have Been [Before] and You'll See Actually in the

282
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:44,129
Material That you learn We Show a lot of?

283
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:49,860
New Techniques Or Different techniques or Different Ways of Thinking about things and I think This kind of

284
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:55,920
Different Way of Building the Course Perhaps, was Really Helpful and Coming up with this kind of more creative Approach

285
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,710
so not everybody in the Course

286
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:10,049
In the In-Person Course were able [to] put in the at least eight Hours A, week but the vast Majority were

287
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
And Those who Didn't

288
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:20,340
Still Completed The Course They Just Found They Didn't Necessarily pick everything up the way that they hoped

289
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,939
They Would but of Course the nice Thing is you Can, always come back to it later [so]

290
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:29,999
[our] suggestion Would be now that it's a mooc now that you don't have to do it every Single Week

291
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:36,450
Ideally you will put in the ten Hours A week did you, want to talk about those [turn] out a little bit Rachel yeah

292
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:40,019
We wanted To give You some Suggestions on how how to use that Time?

293
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,980
and so the Videos are between Two and Two and a half Hours Long

294
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,950
and so

295
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,290
With Those Videos

296
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,660
You May find it Helpful as you

297
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:56,999
Review Them to use These notes A service Is coming from our Wiki Wiki say I?

298
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,909
There's A Page for each Lesson that has

299
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,750
Notes

300
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:08,820
Kind of About the Lesson it, also has links to other other Resources that May be useful to you

301
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:15,359
These Notes Are Pretty complete They're not [Designed] to be Read Entirely Independently from the Video Lesson

302
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,610
But They Are something Which you can

303
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,639
Read on your way to Work Maybe when you don't have

304
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:24,009
It's not Convenient to Actually Watch the Lesson

305
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:26,350
So I was going to Say

306
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,990
We're Expecting that you'll Watch the Lessons more Than Once

307
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,810
You know so the first Time Through [you're] Kind of Watching to get

308
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:36,190
Maybe A lot of the high Level Ideas then you'll Probably want to Read the Wiki

309
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:41,020
Try out The Notebooks and then then go back and Watch the Lesson again and

310
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:46,929
Kind of Maybe to get more Details yeah I don't think Any of our Students in the In-Person Course Just Watch the Lessons Once

311
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:50,080
They saw Them live of Course but then, we, also they?

312
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,389
Also had the recording from the next day and I think Everybody has spoken to Watch them at least Twice and

313
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,800
Then of Course The other Thing you've got [is] the notebooks the Notebooks as you

314
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,959
See, has Quite A lot of Pros in Them as well

315
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:10,569
[They've] Got Quite A Lot [of] Additional Detail that, We don't Necessarily get Into in the Video Lesson but Most Importantly as

316
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:13,509
We described They Give you an Environment in Which you Can Experiment?

317
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,160
in

318
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:22,060
Fact not only do We suggest that you Experiment We have A very Specific suggestion about how to use These Notebooks?

319
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:28,209
yeah so we recommend that you Read Through the Notebook and then and This is after you've Watched the Video

320
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:33,280
At least Once and Everything Makes sense [put] it Aside and Try Creating A

321
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:39,849
New a new Notebook where you go Through [that] Process Yourself [and] so this is from scratch right This is like Creating your Own

322
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:43,450
Notebook to Test that you Can Actually Build it Yourself [yeah]

323
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:49,359
We do not want you to just hit Shift enter Shift Center and run Through the Existing Notebook Because again the test of Whether

324
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,200
Whether you know something is Can you Can you build and Code With it Yourself

325
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,930
So if You get Stuck you can

326
00:25:55,930 --> 00:26:00,279
Always Then go back in [Or] third of the Class Notebook and then rather Than Copying and Pasting it

327
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,060
Make Sure you do Understand what it's Saying Maybe Look up some

328
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:11,050
Documentation About That Concept and Then put That Notebook Aside and See if you Can now do it Yourself so in A sense you're

329
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:15,430
Plagiarizing A lot from the Notebook but you're plagiarizing in A good way you know

330
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:22,450
you're plagiarizing not by Copying and Pasting but by plagiarizing the Concepts and Making sure that you Can recreate them Yourself

331
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:29,589
And then if You have that have Questions Please ask Them and the Forums are The first place you Should go to

332
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:33,489
And first search to See if Someone's Already Asked your Question as

333
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:37,329
We said [Earlier] There's separate Thread for each Lesson that are Already [a.m.]

334
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:43,748
Tons of Helpful Questions and Answers From the Students That Took our In-Person Course in Fact There's a great Quote Which

335
00:26:43,749 --> 00:26:49,899
We talked [About] in One of the Lessons From the head of Google Brain who Says that the rule of Google Brain Is that if

336
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:53,649
You have a problem you first of all try to Fix it Yourself for half an Hour

337
00:26:54,769 --> 00:27:01,689
[and] if After Half an Hour you Can't Fix it Yourself you then have to ask Somebody so that ensures that you

338
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:06,909
Always Give it A go Yourself and Hopefully Learn from the Experience but you

339
00:27:06,909 --> 00:27:11,679
Never waste too much Time on [something] Which somebody Else Can Help you with yes This created Ways

340
00:27:13,879 --> 00:27:20,708
So if Rachel Said the Forums are Really Helpful Resource and when you go to the Forums you'll find that There's A lot of Existing

341
00:27:20,929 --> 00:27:26,048
Discussions There's A separate Discussion for Every Lesson for Example and each of Those

342
00:27:26,209 --> 00:27:30,578
Discussions You'll See That There's a summary of the Existing Discussion at the start so you

343
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:32,389
May find that what you need Is

344
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:35,108
Already in The Question and answers There

345
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:36,649
If it's not of Course

346
00:27:36,649 --> 00:27:42,758
Feel free to Add your Question and you'll Generally Found it's responded to Within a small Number of Hours

347
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:46,119
Maybe by Rachel or I or maybe by, one at the other Students

348
00:27:48,259 --> 00:27:54,189
The Other Thing you May find helpful Is that each Lesson has a timeline on the Wiki and Those Hyperlinks are Actually

349
00:27:54,319 --> 00:28:00,099
Hyperlinks Directly to the Part of the Video Which Discusses That Topic so if you're Trying to remember how

350
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:04,989
Momentum Works you Can Just Click on that Link and you'll Jump straight to me Telling you about Momentum

351
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:11,498
As Rachel Said There's, also a number of resources Available to Help you

352
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:18,189
So this Is Taken from the front Page of our Wiki there's a whole Section of tools With links Where you Can Learn About

353
00:28:18,409 --> 00:28:21,818
Learn more About each of the pieces that We use in The development Environment?

354
00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:28,059
[and] so our goal here [Is] not to be a single source of Truth if Somebody Else has Already done A great Job of Teaching

355
00:28:28,059 --> 00:28:31,148
One of These tools we'll leave it to them so?

356
00:28:31,149 --> 00:28:36,338
We don't attempt to give you a great Bosch Reference Or a great Umpire Reference Because

357
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:40,059
People Have Already Done that yeah so if you want to learn more About one of These things

358
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:46,419
Jump on to the Wiki Click Through Here and You'll find some curated resources that We think are Really Helpful?

359
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,980
so this Lesson

360
00:28:50,389 --> 00:28:51,549
You're Going to Cover a lot

361
00:28:51,549 --> 00:28:54,249
Of Stuff But These are the four things to Keep in mind

362
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:58,539
By the end of the Lesson [you] want to Make sure that you Can create an Aws Instance

363
00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:00,470
That you Can connect To [it] with

364
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:08,439
Ssh so you Can run a Cupidon Notebook Image and you Can run Those That State-Of-The-Art Custom Model Code that we showed you Earlier?

365
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,450
So first Three things

366
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:16,960
You're Going to be Doing every single Project in Every Single Lesson so you're going to want to be Really Comfortable at doing that [and]

367
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:21,939
For Those of You who doesn't haven't done That before it might Take you a little while to get the Hang of it and Maybe

368
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,419
A few

369
00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:25,419
Unsuccessful Attempts First

370
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:31,719
So this first Lesson is unusual in that it's A lot more About kind of getting your development environment set Up and

371
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,880
Not as much About People Learning

372
00:29:34,669 --> 00:29:36,788
so indeed if You've got a Background in

373
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,699
Python and AWs and Os and Linux you

374
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:44,470
May find This Lesson on the Easy Site in Which case you Can zip Through it Pretty fast if you

375
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:51,159
Don't have a background in These tools Today's Class May Seem Really Overwhelming and [We] don't don't want you to be Discouraged by

376
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:57,009
That Because This Is very Different from the future Lessons but it's Necessary to get your environment Set up so that you can be Coding

377
00:29:57,139 --> 00:30:02,709
Throughout The Course Yeah i mean the folks who Didn't Have That Background in the In-Person [Course] Once They

378
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:06,159
Actually Got Through This and often it, was A lot of Work and it

379
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:11,648
Was pretty Tough at The end They Finally Got The point and They Could Say okay I've Set up a gpu Instance in the Cloud

380
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,639
I've Set up my development

381
00:30:13,639 --> 00:30:19,239
Environment and I Have trained from Scratch a model That Can Recognize Dogs from Cats and it was very very

382
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,240
Exciting so if This is hard Work for you

383
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,679
Just know that when You get Through the other end of it [it's] going to be Really exciting

384
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:30,819
so I ask That Everyone who is trying to Decide if This Courses for them and

385
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:36,039
Try at Least The first Few Lessons Since The first Lesson is so much about Setup

386
00:30:36,649 --> 00:30:38,649
Yeah These Lessons [Become]

387
00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:42,819
Obviously We build More and more on the techniques we've learned and so?

388
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:46,960
We're Going to be using this Infrastructure in Every Lesson by the time, We get to Lesson [seven]

389
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:54,879
We're Going to be Looking at some pretty Sophisticated and Custom Neural Network Architectures, we're Going to cover Every Different type of

390
00:30:55,399 --> 00:31:02,119
Sgd Optimization, We're Going to be Covering Convolutional Neural Networks and recurrent Neural Networks [too] be A lot of exciting stuff

391
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,590
and yeah, We really Look Forward to Seeing [you] on the Forums [and]

392
00:31:07,409 --> 00:00:00,000
Good luck With Learning About tech Learning
