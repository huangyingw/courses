# # Clustering

# Clustering techniques are unsupervised learning algorithms that try to group unlabelled data into "clusters", using the (typically spatial) structure of the data itself.
#
# The easiest way to demonstrate how clustering works is to simply
# generate some data and show them in action. We'll start off by importing
# the libraries we'll be using today.

# ## Mean shift

# Most people that have come across clustering algorithms have learnt about **k-means**. Mean shift clustering is a newer and less well-known approach, but it has some important advantages:
# * It doesn't require selecting the number of clusters in advance, but instead just requires a **bandwidth** to be specified, which can be easily chosen automatically
# * It can handle clusters of any shape, whereas k-means (without using special extensions) requires that clusters be roughly ball shaped.

# The algorithm is as follows:
# * For each data point x in the sample X, find the distance between that point x and every other point in X
# * Create weights for each point in X by using the **Gaussian kernel** of that point's distance to x
#     * This weighting approach penalizes points further away from x
#     * The rate at which the weights fall to zero is determined by the **bandwidth**, which is the standard deviation of the Gaussian
# ![Gaussian](http://images.books24x7.com/bookimages/id_5642/fig11-10.jpg)
# * Update x as the weighted average of all other points in X, weighted based on the previous step
#
# This will iteratively push points that are close together even closer
# until they are next to each other.

# So here's the definition of the gaussian kernel, which you may remember
# from high school...

# In our implementation, we choose the bandwidth to be 2.5.
#
# One easy way to choose bandwidth is to find which bandwidth covers one
# third of the data.

def meanshift(data):
    X = np.copy(data)
    for it in range(5):
        for i, x in enumerate(X):
            dist = np.sqrt(((x - X)**2).sum(1))
            weight = gaussian(dist, 2.5)
            X[i] = (np.expand_dims(weight, 1) * X).sum(0) / weight.sum()
    return X


# In[22]:


get_ipython().magic(u'time X=meanshift(data)')


# We can see that mean shift clustering has almost reproduced our original clustering. The one exception are the very close clusters, but if we really wanted to differentiate them we could lower the bandwidth.
#
# What is impressive is that this algorithm nearly reproduced the original
# clusters without telling it how many clusters there should be.
